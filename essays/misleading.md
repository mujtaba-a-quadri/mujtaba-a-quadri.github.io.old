Maybe it's unfair to call Javascript's name misleading: a quick google search reveals that the relationship between Javascript and ECMAscript (its "parent") is... muddy at best. Much like spoken languages, it is hard to nail down exactly what makes a new language (in that case, two dialects become distinct languages once speakers of the dialects can no longer understand each other). Well, the definition used for spoken language doesn't carry over to programming/scripting languages very well. You could make a fair argument that that definition would imply that c, java, and python are simply dialects of each other since "speakers" of one can reasonably understand the others.

### Back to the title then

Javascript's name implies two things to someone unfamiliar with it ("someone" is me, two weeks ago):

1) This language is closely related to Java 

2) This is a scripting language

The punchline is ~~me for thinking a programming language name would give me any useful information when we have language names like "c" and "lisp"~~ that neither of these are particularly true. Well- they are both *somewhat* true. Javascript could definitely be used alongside Java for any scripting needs, as the name implies. But that is a small part of Javascripts potential (and actual) usage. The first of the two claims is less true than the other, Javascript is not really related to Java in any significant way (not any more so than most programming languages are related to each other). The second claim is true, but (as stated and will be restated) does not capture the entire scope of Javascript's usage, as it is also used as a functional language very often. 

### All of that is to say...

I was absolutely dumbfounded upon starting to be exposed to Javascript that it is in fact a very functional language. It felt like a functional language that had design decisions for making scripting easier. Well- more accurate would be to say it is a primarily scripting language that is also has functional elements. As a functional language... I haven't done anything particularly complex in the language yet to really determine my feelings. But considering how popular of a language it is, it certainly must have big merits. As a scripting language I'm even less sure, I'd need to actually use it for some sort of scripting. Perhaps I percieved in a lopsided (towards functional programming and away from scripting) way due to the way I was introduced to the language: through mini workouts of the day \[WODs] (which focused on mostly functional problems). 

### Learning through repetition

Most people probably agree that repitition is a great way (maybe even the *best* way) to learn - it's practically an accepted fact at this point. Most online coding tutorial websites adhere to this principle, they offer lots of exercises that often repeat the same lessons, to help you remember them. It's a lot harder to learn something halfway for the purpose of finishing a task then moving on and forgetting if tasks requiring those skills keep showing up. The sheer volume of practice exercises on many websites encourages you to tackle it across multiple days or weeks or longer, which is good because you need time to let those ideas sink in. Workouts of the Day are a great way to do something similar. The idea is to have constant exercises (maybe not daily but multiple times a week at least) to make sure you do not forget the skills you acquired. It's the polar opposite of cramming for a test the day before (which we all know is one of the *least* effective ways to learn).
