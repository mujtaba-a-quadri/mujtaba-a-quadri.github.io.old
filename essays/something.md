## I have a confession to make

I thought coding standards were pretty much useless. I never used them in my code I wrote for myself, and I didn't have to start using one until a class required it. it felt to me as if all it was doing was making code take twice as long to write (as I comb through it to make it adheres to the guidelines). It also wasn't fun typing a single line and having my IDE scream bloody murder with the amount of warnings I'd recieve. It simply felt like needless busywork to me.

## But then...

I started to actually have to work on other people's code. All of a sudden, I'm reading files (not unlike the ones I wrote myself with no coding standard) which seem to have no rhyme or reason. One letter variable names all over the place, functions I cannot decipher due to 0 commenting, and files with a line count surpassing the current year. It was almost comical: how nonsensical code can look at first glance if not written neatly.

## Now...

Well, it's still true that following a coding standard certainly doesn't make writing code faster. But the bit of extra time you put in on your end will save the next person reading that code (or even yourself, later) hours in trying to decipher what looks like gibberish. I definitely recognize the real benefits of implementing some sort of coding standard, especially for larger scale projects, it seems almost necessary. 


## Example of a SMART question

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2003505/how-do-i-delete-a-git-branch-locally-and-remotely) is a great example of a succinct, helpful question. It gets straight to the point right from the title and the author has the courtesy of showing what they tried themselves before asking:

```
(title) How do I delete a Git branch locally and remotely?
<failed command line attempts>
What should I do differently?
```

There is really not much to say here, it's a very effective question. It also helped many other people due to its very clear title being easy to search for. It sits as one of the highest upvoted posts on stack overflow, and has been viewed over 8 million times.

## Conclusion

It is very important to value the time of and respect other people online (and in general!) - especially those who are volunteering to help you. Acting entitled to being handed a solution is a great way of being ignored or insulted even. Websites like stack overflow are fantastic for allowing us to quickly find solutions to issues and resolve them without having to do hours of testing or combing through a manual. But it can also be used lazily as a personal tutor. It's critical to remember to ask smart questions, as they can often resolve the issue before you even finish typing them.
