# 1. Overview
This idea was brainstormed and fleshed out by our group: Me (Mujtaba Quadri), Sydney Chun, Jackie Wu, and Leeden Raquel.

### The problem

Keeping track of all your assignments in all of your classes is tough work, and that's without mentioning actually doing the assignments! Especially with the shift to online learning, it's harder than ever to remember (or know) what needs to get done: how many different websites are professors having you submit your work on?

### The solution

We want to make a UH calendar, where users can "subscribe" to their classes, so that all of their due dates for all classes can be found in one place.

# 2. Page ideas
- Home page with prompt to log in
- Sign in/Sign up page
- Landing page with clickable cards for each class
- Calendar pages
  - Specific calendars for each class
  - General calendar with all classes 

# 3. Use case ideas
- Create an ics 314, section 01 class
- Users sign up for 314-01
- Create a sample problem and due date for 314-01
- Create a class meeting time for 314-01
- Create another ics 314, section 02 class
- Create a class meeting time for 314-02
- Create an exam for both 314 sections

# 4. Beyond the basics
- Support more classes
- Support input/editing from professors (giving them a higher user role)
- Link to assignment or info on assignment in description on calendar
- Support with other calendar apps (import/export data)
- Allow users to submit assignments for their class through a form, updating everyone's calendar for that class
