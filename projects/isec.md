The International Structural Engineering and Construction \[ISEC] Society is a journal/publication. They publish research papers of many different topics and hold semi-annual conferences where authors who have had their works published can present their works. There is a system in place for authors to submit their abstracts which will be reviewed and potentially accepted, in which case authors can submit the full manuscript for review. A new branch of the website is created after each conference, where the publications are viewable.

The most substantial work I’ve done for my job with ISEC is a project that I built alongside [Mark Young](https://markyoung010.github.io/) in which we added significant enhancements to the [CRM](https://www.conferencereviewmanager.com/) version of the code. We added new features in order to funnel the large amount of papers into smaller categories so that more editors can work on assigning peer reviewers.

Working on the ISEC society website gave me my first experience with full-stack development and web application design. I had to learn how the web development languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP in our case) all work together, and also learn to use MySQL. Working on this website was also my first look at what it’s like working on top of code other people made, which can be quite difficult. I also have to make sure I do not inadvertently break anything whenever I add new things to the existing very large codebase, and make sure they adhere to the current flow/structure of the website.
