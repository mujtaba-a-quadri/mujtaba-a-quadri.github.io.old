This last semester I took Software Engineering II (which I will call by its class number: 414), a semester after taking the first class (Software Engineering, or 314). The class wasn't exactly what I expected, it was quite different to the first one. The first one spent much of the semester teaching us new technologies, building up a technology stack. The final project of 314 (which took up the last third or so of the semester) then put all of this new knowledge to use and tasked us with building a full-stack web app. I thought 414 would do something similar, teaching us many new concepts before having a final project that puts it all to use. Instead: 414 relies on the knowledge gained from the first class and tasks us with building something like the final project of 314, but at a much larger scale.

So this ends up meaning: instead of the full stack project being worked on for roughly a third of the semester, it's the entire semester. Instead of having 3 milestones/large updates, we have 6. Instead of 4 group members we have 8. And lastly instead of our project being a sort of "proof of concept" website, it was actually being built to meet a [specific customer](https://sites.google.com/view/hawaiihomeproject/about?authuser=0)'s needs. 

The class was a lot more hands-off: where 314 had multiple assignments and deadlines per week for most of the semester, and then specific requirements for each milestone for the project; 414 didn't have much in the way of specific requirements, and left the work to the groups to decide how to make the most appealing app to our customers. The class was scheduled for an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week just like 314, but we often ended class within 5 minutes. This - again - left us to figure out amongst ourselves (in our groups) what exactly should be done in during that day/week.

While I was surprised at the way the class was structured, being so different to the first, I quite liked it. The structure of the class actually naturally follows the first one, as the final project oif 314 was much more hands off than the rest of the class, so that transitioned reasonably into 414 which was extremely hands off. I appreciated the structure of the class because it's much closer to what an actual software engineer's work would probably look like: blurry demands for an app that a group of programmers has to work out into something comprehensible. 

Unfortunately, I think I have trouble without such hard and fast requirements, and I couldn't help but notice the similarities to my other ICS class: 491. This class had us participate in hackathons with very general prompts for what sort of app to build, leaving us with a final deadline and not much else in terms of direction. balancing these two alongside my other classes was a struggle, as classes with this sort of structure can really take as much time as you throw at them (as the projects can grow to any size you're willing to work towards). I think, in the future, I will try to stick to *one* "open-ended/time-sink" class per semester.
