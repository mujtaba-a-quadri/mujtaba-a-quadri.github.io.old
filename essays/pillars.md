There are many important pillars to the discipline of software engineering. These consist of technologies and ideas (standards) that - while may be daunting to learn at first - make life easier for developers and users alike. Here are some of what I consider to be the quintessential parts of any software engineering project. 

### Development Environments

A development environment is a program that allows you to edit the files of your program more easily and with specialized tools like syntax highlighting for . The alternative to a development environment is a text editor, many compilation errors, and lots of pain. Of all the technologies on this list, this is likely the most essential (hence why it is first). A development environment will save you loads of time trying to figure out simple errors with syntax, so you can spend that time figuring out the logical errors you missed instead! Most popular development environments also come with many useful tools like comparing files or global searches.

### Version control

Version control is a way of backing up a codebase as it is worked on and changes are made, and also to document those changes. Version control becomes very important once a project gets big enough (really, anything past a single directory is reason enough for version control) or when working with multiple people. Working without version control is like working without a harness: it’s okay if you’re on the ground, but once things start building up, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone not using it.

### Coding Standards

Coding standards are a set of guidelines for writing code one chooses to follow. These guidelines intend to make code easier to read and make the intent of the writer clear. They stop the writer from doing redundant or unnecessary things. They also make the code easier for the writer to read on a second inspection, as with time code runs the risk of being unintelligible even to the writer.

### Project Management

There are many different ways of breaking down project management. These can be useful for a wide range of types of projects, as there are many different approaches. A team can adopt a blueprint fitting the number of members and how they best work. It is important when following a pattern however to be open to change and seeing what works and what doesn’t, after all: that’s how these patterns formed in the first place. 

### In closing 

Of course: it is possible to ignore all of these, opting to design a project using minimal tools and technologies. One could opt to use a simple text editor and constantly overwrite the same files when changes are made with no backups. These 4 pillars of software engineering are roughly ordered in terms of how big a project has to get before they become useful. So a development environment should almost always be used (perhaps you wouldn’t need one for a single file program). Then version control should be used as the project scales. Coding standards become very important when others work on the same project or it is a long term project. And finally project management patterns are most useful for bigger projects with multiple people constantly working.
